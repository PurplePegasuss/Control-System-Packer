# Control System Packer

![alt text](https://i.ibb.co/Ph0x5bG/Untitled.png)

Control System Packer is a lightweight, low-level program to transform energy equations into the compact libraries for control systems. Packer supports Python 🐍 and C++ 💻libraries.  

## Features

- Input the energy equations and get a compact library for the chosen language. 
- Parametrize the system for usage with different parameters
- Get a control system out of robot's physical equations

> Our goal is to make the lives of robotics developers easier, so you
> can just type in the energy equations and obtain ready-to-use libraries.
> You can import them straight away into the robot for the control!

## Tech

Packer now supports 2 types of the language libraries:

- [Python] - Python libraries
- [C++] - C++ libraries

And of course Control System Packer is open source with a [public repository][Packer] (to be changed after release) on GitHub.

## Installation
